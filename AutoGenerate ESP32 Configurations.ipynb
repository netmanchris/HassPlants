    "# Miflora BLE Plant Sensor + ESP32 Config Generation for Home Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most things, what was easy at low volume can start to show challenges when reaching certain scales. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is intended to help automate the creation of my \n",
    "ome assistant based Plant monitoring setup. This setup uses a combindation of the Xiaomi Miflora BLE Plant sensors, ESP32wroom RevD boards, and Home Assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has been a work in progress and will likely change as I experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## WHY\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "I killed plants. I'd like my plants to not die.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not? Home Automation is supposed to help us and make our lives easier. This project will allow me to know exactly when any given plant in my home needs water and/or fertilization. I'm not wandering around the house touching plants to see if the it's dry or using a plant monitoring spike from plant to plant to check the soil fertilization. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started this project, it was possible to integrate the Miflora Sensor suing the native BLE Home Assistant Integration, but as of 2022.7 release, the bluethooth libraries that Home Assistant used are no longer usable which will break existing MiFlora integrations using the BLE, and makes BLE no longer an option moving forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/20227BLEBroke.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So moving forward, the ESPHome based is the easiest of the available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"It's the easiest way\" reason, the other major reason to use the ESPHome based integration is that it allows you to esaily overcome the distance limitations that come along with Bluetooth as a networking technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For users wanting to leverage the simple ESPHome based solution, this can be easily done manually and allows you to deploy this solution in \n",
    "\n",
    "- Scan the BLE mac-address of the MiFlora sensor using an android-based device (iOS devices don't show the mac-address at the time of this writting)\n",
    "- Connect the ESP32 to the ESPHome interface in Home Assistant and add the Miflora specific configuration using the mac-address detected in step 1.\n",
    "- Manually configurat the YAML definition for the Plant integration using the Sensors entities assigned in step 2.\n",
    "- Add the new plant entities to dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/singlesensor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaled Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "When the same four steps above need to be performed at larger scales, it quickly became obvious to me that I needed to do something to automate these steps. Although this process can be useful to automate the creation of the various configuration files when dealing with just a few sensors, the majority of the work of this project was performed to deal with the a setup with the following attributes\n",
