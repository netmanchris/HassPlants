    "# Miflora BLE Plant Sensor + ESP32 Config Generation for Home Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most things, what was easy at low volume can start to show challenges when reaching certain scales. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is intended to help automate the creation of my home assistant based Plant monitoring setup. This setup uses a combination of the Xiaomi [Miflora Sensor](https://geni.us/HKFMiflora) BLE Plant sensors, [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) wroom RevD boards, and Home Assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has been a work in progress and will likely change as I experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## WHY\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "I killed plants. I'd like my plants to not die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seriously. I made the double mistake of over-fertilizing a bunch of plants AND doing it when the soil was really dry. From what I understand, when plants are overly dry, the roots suck up as much water as they can when they finally have access to water. The combination of the two means that the roots suck up far too much fertilizer in the water and burn out the roots and plant completely.  Leaving you something looking a little like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/dead_spider.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not? Home Automation is supposed to help us and make our lives easier. This project will allow me to know exactly when any given plant in my home needs water and/or fertilization. I'm not wandering around the house touching plants to see if the it's dry or using a plant monitoring spike from plant to plant to check the soil fertilization. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started this project, it was possible to integrate the Miflora Sensor suing the native BLE Home Assistant Integration, but as of 2022.7 release, the bluethooth libraries that Home Assistant used are no longer usable which will break existing [Miflora Sensor](https://geni.us/HKFMiflora) integrations using the BLE, and makes BLE no longer an option moving forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/20227BLEBroke.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So moving forward, the ESPHome based is the easiest of the available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"It's the easiest way\" reason, the other major reason to use the ESPHome based integration is that it allows you to esaily overcome the distance limitations that come along with Bluetooth as a networking technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For users wanting to leverage the simple ESPHome based solution, this can be easily done manually and allows you to deploy this solution in \n",
    "\n",
    "- Scan the BLE mac-address of the [Miflora Sensor](https://geni.us/HKFMiflora) using an android-based device (iOS devices don't show the mac-address at the time of this writting)\n",
    "- Connect the [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) to the ESPHome interface in Home Assistant and add the [Miflora Sensor](https://geni.us/HKFMiflora) specific configuration using the mac-address detected in step 1.\n",
    "- Manually configurat the YAML definition for the Plant integration using the Sensors entities assigned in step 2.\n",
    "- Add the new plant entities to dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/singlesensor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaled Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "When the same four steps above need to be performed at larger scales, it quickly became obvious to me that I needed to do something to automate these steps. Although this process can be useful to automate the creation of the various configuration files when dealing with just a few sensors, the majority of the work of this project was performed to deal with the a setup with the following attributes\n",

    "You'll want to be careful when re running this multiple times as, depending on the order of the plant sensors in the CSV file, the specific 13 sensors that will be allocated to a specific [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) may not be the same each time you run this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a single [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) per room, the order shouldn't matter, but if you have multiple [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32)'s dedicated to a single room because of the amount of plants in that room, you may accidently move the sensors from one [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) to a second.\n",

    "This will result in Home Assistant automatically appending a \"_1\" or \"_2\" to the end of the entity name to ensure a unique entity ID in the home assistant database.  \n",

    "This will break the rest of the templates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to deal with this would be to completely remove the [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) (delete the integration for that specific [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32)) and then perform a full reboot of Home Assistant to clear any remaining cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's possible to manually remove the sensors, it can be a slightly more painful procedure. Because the configurations are all automatically generated, I've found it easier to simply remove and re-add the [ESP32](https://geni.us/HKGesp32) for a specific room.\n",
