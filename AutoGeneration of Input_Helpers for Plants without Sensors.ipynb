    "\n",
    "Seriously. I made the double mistake of over-fertilizing a bunch of plants AND doing it when the soil was really dry. From what I understand, when plants are overly dry, the roots suck up as much water as they can when they finally have access to water. The combination of the two means that the roots suck up far too much fertilizer in the water and burn out the roots and plant completely.  Leaving you something looking a little like this.\n",

    "[Miflora Sensor](https://geni.us/HKFMiflora) are kinda awesome, but at scale they can start to be very expensive. When I started this project last year, they could be found as low as eleven dollars a piece. At the time of this writting, they are showing on AliExpress at twenty-six average and somewhere around fifty on Amazon Canada.  Too rich for my blood.\n",

You can leverage a combination of a traditional plant sensor to take and track manual readings in combination of existing temperature and light sensors that you likely might already have in your homes.\n",
